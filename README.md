Profile page with user information
different pages with categories to seperate listings
location finder on google maps with API

API(s):
Google Maps API:
Google Maps API helps user to find the exact locationn of a certain booking they made or the location of the hotel they did a reservation under.
It also helps  users find the nearest hotel to the bookings they made or find attractions near the hotels they are staying at.
RestDB API:
We used RestDB because we thought it was a useful API to store login information for returning users.
We used the API for our login page.


Design Process:
We deviated from the wireframe itself.
We also decided to go with a more modern look.
We wanted a video to be at the home page because we thought it would look really cool
We got inspiration from these few websites below:
